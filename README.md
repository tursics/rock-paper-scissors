## what device and browser?

I've tested the game on multiple devices.
It 'should' work on most devices and orientation (the visuals are responsive).
But some old browsers are not supported by default.

Device   |Browser  |Note
---------|---------|-----
Windows  |Chrome   |:heavy_check_mark:
Windows  |Edge     |:heavy_check_mark:
Windows  |FireFox  |:heavy_check_mark:
Windows  |Internet Explorer  |No. By default not!
Mac      |Chrome   |:heavy_check_mark:
Mac      |Safari   |:heavy_check_mark:
Mac      |FireFox  |:heavy_check_mark:
Android Phone  |Chrome   |:heavy_check_mark: best viewed in portrait mode (but is too small already)
Android Tablet |Chrome   |not tested
iPhone   |Safari   |:heavy_check_mark: best viewed in portrait mode (but is too small already)
iPad     |Safari   |tested on a very old safari with a very old browser. Test failed!

## extendable

The number of players is limited to be exact 2. But the business layer and the game logic supports a minimum of 2 players without a maximum number.

The player object is extendable. Currently only a computer "AI" with random choices and a human local player is implemented. But you can write own versions.

The game logic supports multiple game sets.
Current a set of 3 and 5 figures are defined.
But there is no limitaion.
The game logic defines the number and style of figures, the UI is generic and display the needed elements.

## events

The own event system uses a list of named events:

event name          | description
--------------------|------------
vote.open           |Start a new round
vote.player         |A player has voted
vote.finish         |All player has voted. It's time for the results
vote.close          |Finish the current round
ui.show.menu.main   |Show the main menu
ui.show.vote.human  |The local human player should vote
